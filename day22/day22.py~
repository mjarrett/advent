#Magic Missile costs 53 mana. It instantly does 4 damage.
#Drain costs 73 mana. It instantly does 2 damage and heals you for 2 hit points.
#Shield costs 113 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. While it is active, your armor is increased by 7.
#Poison costs 173 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it deals the boss 3 damage.
#Recharge costs 229 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 5 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it gives you 101 new mana.
